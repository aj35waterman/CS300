# CS300
  In these projects, I was solving the problem of creating a program to help academic advisors at ABC University manage course information. The goal was to load course data from a CSV file, store it in a data structure, and give advisors an easy way to print a sorted list of courses or look up a specific course and its prerequisites. I worked with vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees (BSTs) to figure out which one would handle the data best. Understanding how each data structure works was important because it affects the speed and efficiency of the program. After testing them, I found that the BST was the best option since it keeps everything sorted and makes searching faster without needing extra steps.
  I ran into a few issues along the way, for example getting the file parsing right, setting up efficient searching, and making sure the menu worked correctly. I got past these by using my resources and sectioning each issue into there own structure, doing some research, and testing my code until it worked. These projects have changed the way I think about designing software. I’ve gotten better at planning things out before I start coding, keeping my code organized, and writing it in a way that’s easy to read and update later. I feel more confident now in building programs that are maintainable, adaptable, and able to handle bigger projects in the future.
